I implemented a responsive Booking Detail Page in Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
The page includes:
- A reusable, accessible BookingForm with contact, payment, and billing fields.
- An OrderSummary component that calculates totals and uses TypeScript typing.
- A responsive layout with a grid (form on one side, sticky sidebar summary on desktop).
- A CancellationPolicy / Ground Rules section documented properly.
- Code follows modern best practices: semantic HTML, ARIA/labels, autocomplete attributes, TypeScript typing, and reusable components.

Your task:
1. Review all my code in the project.
2. Fix any errors, bugs, or broken imports.
3. Ensure that `pages/booking/index.tsx` correctly imports and uses `BookingForm`, `OrderSummary`, and `CancellationPolicy` from `components/booking/`.
4. Verify TypeScript typings are correct and strict-safe.
5. Ensure Tailwind classes are applied correctly for responsiveness (mobile â†’ desktop).
6. Check that the sticky sidebar works properly on desktop without breaking layout on mobile.
7. Clean up unused imports, console logs, or redundant code.
8. Ensure consistent coding style (naming, indentation, prop typing).
9. Suggest or implement small optimizations for performance and accessibility.

Output:
- Show me the corrected code files (with full content, not just diffs).
- Explain what changes you made and why.
